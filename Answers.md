1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

Client side routing:
1.	Loads whole page on the initial request.
2.	Initial load time slower.
3.	When request is sent the page is not refreshed, only some elements inside the application will change.
4.	Data flow between the user and a website is handled internally by the JS.

Server side routing:
1.	It only requests the data that is needed.
2.	The initial load time is faster.
3.	When a new request is sent to the server the whole page is refreshed.
4.	Data going to a server and back with every user interaction.
